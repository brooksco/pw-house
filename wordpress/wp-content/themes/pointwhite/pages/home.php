	<h3>Welcome to the pacific northwest</h3>

	<p>

		Retreat to the privacy of a modern cottage designed by Jetson
		Luddite Architects and featured in Coastal Living and Pacfic
		Northwest Magazines. Located on Point White, Bainbridge
		Island’s best no-bank beach, the cottage is just steps away
		from breathtaking views of Mount Rainier, Rich Passage and
		Blake Island. The yard is professionally landscaped and the
		beach is accessed by a garden path.

	</p>

	<p>

		Amenities include a queen size bed and four twin bunks, a
		full bath, washer and dryer, fluffy terry robes and fresh
		linens. There is an abundance of materials for reading,
		writing, sketching, stargazing and dreaming. The cottage
		is set in a secluded garden and shares 180 feet of
		waterfront. It’s a birder’s paradise, with kingfishers,
		redwing blackbirds, eagles, osprey, blue herons, pipers,
		swallows and songbirds. You might encounter otters, sea
		lions and even the occasional orca pod.
